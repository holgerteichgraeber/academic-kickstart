I am an Operations Research Scientist in the Data Science team at [Convoy](https://convoy.com/). Here, I work on building efficiency into our network of shipments. I develop, deploy, and maintain machine learning and optimization algorithms in production, and I provide quantitative insights to inform product decisions. A high-level description of the problem we are solving for can be found [here](https://medium.com/convoy-tech/algorithmically-bundling-shipments-cb1ada68e0d8).  

Previously, I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Energy Resources Engineering at Stanford University. My advisor was [Prof. Adam Brandt](https://profiles.stanford.edu/adam-brandt) and I was a Wells Family Stanford Graduate Fellow.

In my Ph.D. research, I focused on applying state-of-the-art computational tools at the intersection of machine learning and optimization to energy systems problems. As an example, I have worked extensively on the development of new algorithms and applications of time-series aggregation for infrastructure planning and operations.
Out of my research, two open-source software packages have emerged: [TimeSeriesClustering](git.io/TimeSeriesClustering) implements unsupervised learning methods for time-series data, and [CapacityExpansion](git.io/CapacityExpansion) provides an extensible, data-driven infrastructure planning tool for energy systems.

During my studies, I interned at the battery software company Doosan GridTech; in the renewable energy forecasting division of Vaisala (formerly 3Tier); in the market optimization group at RWE Power, one of Europe's largest utility companies; and at ThyssenKrupp, one of the world's largest steel producers.
