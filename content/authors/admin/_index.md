I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Energy Resources Engineering at Stanford University. My advisor is [Prof. Adam Brandt](https://profiles.stanford.edu/adam-brandt) and I am a Wells Family Stanford Graduate Fellow.

In my research, I focus on applying state-of-the-art computational tools at the intersection of optimization and machine learning to energy systems problems. As an example, I have worked extensively on the development of new algorithms and applications of time-series aggregation for infrastructure planning and operations.
Out of my research, two open-source software packages have emerged: [TimeSeriesClustering](git.io/TimeSeriesClustering)) implements unsupervised learning methods for time-series data, and [CapacityExpansion](git.io/CapacityExpansion) provides an extensible, data-driven infrastructure planning tool for energy systems.

I have previously interned at the battery software company Doosan GridTech; in the renewable energy forecasting division of Vaisala (formerly 3Tier); in the market optimization group at RWE Power, one of Europe's largest utility companies; and at ThyssenKrupp, one of the world's largest steel producers.
